    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p> I am in my senior year, pursueing a bachelors degree in Computer Science, at California State 
        University, Sacramento. I aim to get into the field of cybersecurity by the time I graduate.
        Since I already have a personal website, I am hosting this site on a new github account that I 
        made especially for CSC 193a. Outside of school, I enjoy hiking, travelling, working out, and 
        motorcycles. Interested in what my actual website portfolio looks like? 
       <a href="https://ikjxt.github.io"> Feel free to check it out. </a>.
